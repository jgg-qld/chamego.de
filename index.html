<h2>MindSetting</h2>
<p>Mindsetting was born from my desire to help others. During my years as a scientist, I witnessed students and colleagues struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance in high-pressure environments. I was preparing to shift my career focus to mental health when I became pregnant. While this was a wonderful time in my life, the postnatal phase proved incredibly challenging, and I found myself struggling to stay in a positive mental space. My baby had trouble sleeping, and after a long journey, we discovered he had multiple food intolerances. Eventually, we found our "new normal."
 </p>
However, more challenges arose. My maternity leave ended, and so did my contract with the University, leaving me a new mom without a job, grappling with an identity and confidence crisis. Like many mothers, I struggled to find flexible work, facing countless job rejections. After taking courses in yoga, meditation, nutrition, and coaching, and exploring activities I truly enjoyed, I discovered a new path. My passion for helping new moms find alignment and contentment in their lives grew stronger, leading me to create Mindsetting.
 </p>
Mindsetting is centred on the continuous process of rewiring our brains and nervous systems to work in our favour. Using deep relaxation techniques, transformative conversations and targeted coaching exercises, I offer a holistic approach to balancing mind and body, guiding you toward alignment and fulfillment in your life.

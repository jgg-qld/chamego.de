<h1> MindSetting </h1>
<p>Rejuvenating Women's Mind through Yoga, Meditation, Nutrition, and Life Coaching</p>
</header>
<section>
<h2>MindSetting</h2>
<p>Mindsetting was born from my desire to help others. During my years as a scientist, I witnessed students and colleagues struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance in high-pressure environments. I was preparing to shift my career focus to mental health when I became pregnant. While this was a wonderful time in my life, the postnatal phase proved incredibly challenging, and I found myself struggling to stay in a positive mental space. My baby had trouble sleeping, and after a long journey, we discovered he had multiple food intolerances.
I sought help from various organizations, and with the right nutritional adjustments and sleep techniques, we eventually found our "new normal."
However, more challenges arose. My maternity leave ended, and so did my contract with the University, leaving me a new mom without a job, grappling with an identity and confidence crisis. Like many mothers, I struggled to find flexible work, facing countless job rejections. After taking courses in yoga, meditation, nutrition, and coaching, and exploring activities I truly enjoyed, I discovered a new path.
My passion for helping new moms find alignment and contentment in their lives grew stronger, leading me to create Mindsetting.
Mindsetting is centred on the continuous process of rewiring our brains and nervous systems to work in our favour. Using deep relaxation techniques, transformative conversations and targeted coaching exercises, I offer a holistic approach to balancing mind and body, guiding you toward alignment and fulfillment in your life.

 </p>
<p>The sessions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifying your lifestyle, as well as your beliefs, stress, and confidence levels.</li>
    <li>Exercises focused on acceptance, emotional regulation, and deep relaxation to balance your nervous system, providing you with practical tools to reshape your mindset and perception of the world.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Our sessions take place in a safe, non-judgmental space where I listen with care and empathy, helping you reshape the narratives of your life. If you are interested, please let me know at re.mindsetting@gmail.com and I can send you more details and talk about your wants and needs in more detail.</p>
